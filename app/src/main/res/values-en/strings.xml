\n\n<b>Scope /Content</b>
\nThese data protection regulations apply solely to the use of the app “Arriving in Berlin”, subsequently “App”. If you use any other App or visit any other website, the data protection regulations of the respective website provider apply. This includes cases when we refer you to a third party website via a link or when a service from a third party is embedded in our App. In such cases, we recommend that you inform yourself on the linked website about how they handle personal data.

	•	Location: Intermittent device location and timestamp\n
	•	Speed and heading: Just that\n
	•	Visits Dwell-time and location
\nThe collected location data is not associated with any identifying information, including names, permanent IDs, email addresses, IP addresses, or phone numbers.

\n\nWith every event the App reports the following data to Mapbox:
\n
	•	Session and instance identifiers: UUIDs recording the installation of the app and its specific use, including the IDFV in iOS\n
	•	App ID: Application identifier\n
	•	Device data OS type, device model\n
	•	Connectivity data: Whether the device is connected via wifi, CAT5, or cellular data\n
	•	View data: The device orientation, screen resolution, and font scaling\n
	•	Timestamp: the time and date of the event
\nThe above event data is collected in batch and reported to Mapbox asynchronously.

\n\n<b>Purposes of Data Processing </b>
\nMapbox uses the data collected for internal diagnostic and analytic purposes, to improve its mapping products and services and to provide its services to end users of its customers.
